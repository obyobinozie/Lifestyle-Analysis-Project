# Lifestyle & Health Analysis Project
Uncovering hidden patterns and outliers in lifestyle data using PostgreSQL and Power BI.
## Overview
This project explores Demographic and lifestyle drivers such as BMI, age, gender, workout experience and diet_type. The goal is to identify **outliers** that may signal unique habits or potential health risks, and to visualize these insights in an interactive dashboard.
## Current Dashboard 
**BMI Outliers** visualized in Power BI | Data sourced from PostgreSQL LIFESTYLE database | Insights: Identifies individuals outside healthy BMI ranges 
**[Screenshots will be added to the 'docs/'folder once finalised.]** 
## Project Structure 
'data/raw/' → raw datasets
'sql/'  SQL scripts for queries and transformations 
'notebooks/' Jupyter notebooks for exploration 
'docs/' documentation and dashboard screenshots 
## 📊 Dataset
This dashboard uses the 
[LIFESTYLE dataset](./data/Lifestyledataset.csv)to analyze workout types, calorie burn, and BMI trends.
## Tools Used 
**PostgreSQL (psql)**  file encoding conversion |Schema alignment| cleaned data import
**Power BI**  for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling 
**GitHub**  for version control and collaboration 
**Excel**  for quick checks and formatting 
## How to Use 
This section will be updated once SQL scripts and Power BI dashboards are uploaded. For now, the repository contains the project structure and documentation.
